# React Part 1

You need to create a travel app in **React** by rewriting pre-made markup. It can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/BinaryStudioAcademy/react-homework) in the `markup` folder.

The application must contain the following pages:

- `/sing-up` - sign up page
- `/sing-in` - sign in page
- `/` - main page with all trips, search and filters
- `/trip/:tripId` - trip information page
- `/bookings` - list of current user's bookings

### Header

<img width="750" alt="header" src="./images/header.png">

- must be displayed on all pages
- logo is a link to the main page - `/`
- navigation block is displayed on all pages except `/sing-up` and `/sing-in`
- navigation consists of two elements
    - the first element links to the `/bookings` page
    - when you hover over the second element, a list appears with username and Sign Out button
    <br/>
    <img width="224" alt="profile-nav" src="./images/profile-nav.png">

- all fields are required

- block with filters contains:
    - search bar
    - two selects for duration and level
- when entering a value in the search bar or changing filters, the corresponding cards should be displayed
- trip card contains the following elements:
    - picture
    - name of the trip
    - trip information - duration and level of difficulty
    - price
    - button leading to the trip page

### Trip page

<img width="750" alt="trip" src="./images/trip.png">

- contains complete information about a trip - picture, name, duration, level, description and price
- when you click Book a trip button, a modal window opens
- modal window

    <img width="300" alt="modal" src="./images/modal.png">

    - contains a name, duration and level of the trip
    - form contains the following fields:
        - Date - planned date, should be in the future
        - Number of guest - should be from 1 to 10 inclusive
    - final price is equal to the price multiplied by the number of guests
    - when you press a close button in the upper right corner, the form closes

### Bookings page

<img width="750" alt="bookings" src="./images/bookings.png">
    
- list of bookings
    - cards must be sorted by date from nearest to farthest
- booking card contains:
    - name of the trip
    - booking information - number of guests, planned date, final price
    - cancel button in the upper right corner - when pressed, the card should disappear from the list

## Requirements

- all the functionality described above must be present
- you have to use pre-made styles
- keep all data in a component state of the corresponding page
- when switching to any unknown route, the user must be redirected to the main page
- use only **React** and **React Router** libraries (without backend, redux and other libraries)
- you can use any CSS-libraries

## What will be evaluated

- functionality
- splitting and reusing components
- **React Router** routing
- components structure. Function components first
- data encapsulation (component must receive data via props, local state only where needed)
- clean code

Maximum score: 9. You can get one more poing if you:

- deploy app to any service. For example, [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
- use functional approaches and patterns.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
