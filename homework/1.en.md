# React Part 1

You need to create a travel app in **React** by rewriting pre-made markup. It can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/BinaryStudioAcademy/react-homework) in the `markup` folder.

The application must contain the following pages:

- `/sign-up` - sign up page
- `/sign-in` - sign in page
- `/` - main page with all trips, search and filters
- `/trip/:tripId` - trip information page
- `/bookings` - list of current user's bookings

### Header

- must be displayed on all pages
- logo is a link to the main page - `/`
- navigation block is displayed on all pages except `/sign-up` and `/sign-in`
- navigation consists of two elements
    - the first element links to the `/bookings` page
    - when you hover over the second element, a list appears with username and Sign Out button
    - Sign Out navigates to `/sign-in`

## Requirements

- all the functionality described above must be present
- you have to use pre-made styles
- you shouldn't change old classes
- you shouldn't use fetch
- keep all data in a component state of the corresponding page
- when switching to any unknown route, the user must be redirected to the main page
- use only **React** and **React Router** libraries (without backend, redux and other libraries)
- you can use any CSS-libraries

## What will be evaluated

- functionality
- splitting and reusing components
- **React Router** routing
- components structure. Function components first
- data encapsulation (component must receive data via props, local state only where needed)
- clean code

Maximum score: 9. You can get one more poing if you:

- deploy app to any service. For example, [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
- use functional approaches and patterns.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
